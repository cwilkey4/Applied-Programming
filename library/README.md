# Overview

I've worked with SQL databases, SQLite, and MySQL Workbench, but NoSQL and Google Firebase are new to me. Electing to learn it in this fashion gave me an opportunity to do so in a somewhat familiar environment. After working with exclusively with relational databases and fixed schemas, this was a breath of fresh air. While the data is more or less the same, it is stored and organized in a different way. NoSQL focuses on key-values, documents, graphs, or columns, using either relaxed schemas or none at all.

# Cloud Database

This database is meant to loosely represent a library, or at least the beginnnings of one. Though there are two separate collections available in the cloud, we will focus on the modifying the "books" collection within this project.  
Every book is represented by a document id. From there, a number of fields are matched with that id to store a variety of information (title, author name, page count, publisher, and language).

# Future Work

- The initial pacing this time felt pretty good in comparison to other modules. It helped that this one was similar to a previous project.
- I've never worked a NoSQL database before, so this required me to approach a similar project differently. It's good to be mindful of just how many different ways there are to accomplish certain objectives.
- Following the same train of thought as the above point, the fact that this project felt so similar to a previous one encouraged me to use a similar framework. When building and modifying future databases in this manner, I would like to see the python script in constructed in a different manner.
