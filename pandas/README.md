# Overview

{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

{Provide a description of the data set that you are analyzing.  Include the link of where you obtained the data.}

{Describe your purpose for writing this software to analyze the data.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the data set, the questions and answers, the code running and a walkthrough of the code.}
Data Analysis is used when working with data in order to retrieve helpful information. In this way, pre-established questions and concerns can be addressed. It is useful for most any field of work, given that certainty heightens a person's/organization's ability to make wise decisions.

# Data Analysis Results

{List the questions and the answers you found by doing this analysis.}
**Question 1**  
*Which categories are the most common?*  
Family is, by far, the most common category, with a total of 1,746 applications recorded, which outnumbers the following category -- game -- by approximately 650. Tools takes third place, after which there is another dramatic drop before the decline in common apps becomes more gradual.

**Question 2**  
*Which apps have been installed the most?*  
Though no one application was listed to have the highest number of installations, this dataset was still able to provide a large list of contenders -- approximately 70 of them.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* I still have some lingering questions regarding the use of pandas and jupyter notebooks. I would like to experiment with them more. In particular, I would like to familiarize myself more with jupyter notebooks.
* Though I could think of some questions, I do believe the dataframes used could have looked cleaner and better organized. Once I got a passable result, I was reluctant to try moving past that point. 
* One roadblock I wasn't anticipating involved simply reading the csv file in the beginning. I had no issues when reading it from a new notebook, but once that notebook was saved, I would often encounter new issues.
