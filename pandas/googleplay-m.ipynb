This information is useful for determining what most users need/want on their devices. Certain applications, like a weather or map app, is almost guarenteed to be found on most any device because of their universal utility and because they are oftentimes pre-installed.  \n",

That particular information is not available in this dataset, but it is not difficult to get an understanding of which categories might appeal to parents as opposed to youth or children. A majority of these top categories, however, can include a broad selection of people; the apps themselves would likely play a larger role in targeting a specific audience. "

Each of these were recorded to have more than 500,000,000 installations. This remains true even while enlarging the selection. At approximately 75 rows, the number of installations drops. These numbers were not intended to be precise, but they still paint a clear enough image.  \n",

Though it is common for a popular category to have a number of applications, it is not necessarily a fact."
