# Overview

This was an attempt in learning some of the basics of JavaScript. I used event handlers, functions, and arrays throughout the course of this short program. A memory game seemed like a fun and visual learning approach, especially since most everything that was done had a clear impact on the end result.

# Development Environment
I used JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for this project.

# Future Work

- I want to learn how to use more event handlers.
- I need to work on making the most of commments and other forms of organization while programming in order to simplify my understanding of it, as well as making it easier for others to know what is happening. This is especially true when accessing multiple languages and files.
- Though this doesn't directly relate to coding, I would like to learn to articulate myself more clearly during videos and presentations.
