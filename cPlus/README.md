# Overview

This program was constructed to simply read and write to a text file, one that acts as a to-do list. It uses a simple user interface to allow a person to view, add, and remove tasks. In developing this program, I hoped to better grasp the differences between C++ and other C languages. Though similarities exist, it is clear that they are not quite the same. This project also taught me some of the basics behind the Developer Command Prompt for VS Code. Additionally, learning some of these fundamentals will aid me in future projects should I regularly practice them.

# Future Work

- The idea behind this program is quite simple. That is the idea behind learning the fundamentals of a language at first even if it wasn't what I wanted to accomplish at first. I would like to start using what I have now learned during the course of the past few months and build upon them in place of learning yet another language.
- These last few weeks have been somewhat hectic. Even if I think this result is decent enough, I think more could have been done to make something more exciting at the end of the day. Fortunately, there are always future opportunities, and this did work effectively as a tutorial at the very least. 
- The syntax for this language is remarkably similar to C#, but, of course, it is not exactly the same. I want to take more time yet to familiarize myself with the differences between the two. Additionally, this project has helped me realize that I want to solidify my problem-solving skills.
